2,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Ep senior mapping specialist,2025-11-02,2.0,"Benefits - good health and dental insurance ESPP - employee stock program available if one chooses to participate Job Security - once you have this job and are trained, even a pandemic will not get you laid off - it takes much too long to train a new employee",Short-Staffed Teams - this company was previously 4th place among mapping systems/ablation technology within the field. BSC is still playing catch up with well-established competitors and is still struggling to hire faster enough to remain competitive when opportunities arise. The mindset to not already have someone hired and trained/ready for that next opportunity will be where major business misses happen. The teams are not even staffed enough to cover and maintain the business that is already established. Expect long hours and no work life balance.
3,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Manufacturing technician,2025-11-03,5.0,Great work environment A lot of help from upper management They like to hire within Good work life balance A lot of benefits,Projects you worked hard at can get over looked easily by something else.

5,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Senior financial analyst,2025-10-29,2.0,Great pay and some solid benefits,"Culture differs from team to team, really need to improving training method or documentation. Can get crazy workload from the jump and then get minimal support."

8,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Clinical specialist ii,2025-10-27,2.0,"decent pay good benifits ""unlimited time off"" good hours",very poor management not a lot of innovation field reps are last on priority list for company
9,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Technician,2025-07-29,4.0,"Good company, benefits and people",If you work in CA you don't get to partake of their Summer Hours program and there are no alternative benefits so you literally lose out. If you are an hourly employee there is no work/life balance at all. Even if you can do 75% of your job from home they will not let you work from home at all meanwhile you will see others at your same level in other States that ARE able to work from home so it really depends on your Manager but they will blame it on someone higher than them for not allowing you to work from home at all. I am a LONG time employee and happy I am close to retirement...

14,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Clinical specialist,2025-09-09,5.0,"Big corporation, great for job security. Plenty of opportunity to pursue adjacent roles in a variety of departments. Learning environment and benefits are top notch. Upper management very accessible.","Big corporation. Easy to get lost in the shuffle. If you are low on the totem pole, expect to go largely unheard. Sales and upper management are competitive, and years of loyalty and plugging away doesn’t mean you will be considered for a promotion."
15,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Senior financial analyst,2025-10-12,4.0,"Benefits and time off, campus perks, supportive and collaborative environment",Highly matrixed and complex financial systems given the company's growth and acquisitions over the years

17,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Director,2025-09-19,5.0,"Mission driven with the patient at the center of all we do. Very innovative and supportive culture. The leadership teams are real people, approachable. Hybrid schedule at 3 days onsite is best in class right now !","My commute is lengthy, but it is worth it.

22,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Anonymous employee,2025-09-28,1.0,"Speaking about the HQ in Marlborough, specifically Endo - it’s a great place to work if you are a white American or white European: opportunities, preference, first in line for promotions","They will make you miserable if you are not a white American. Lots of micro aggressions, zero opportunities and zero recognition/promotions. They will prioritize white folks. They pride themselves of being diverse and inclusive - that’s just propaganda, only words."
23,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Engineer,2025-10-09,4.0,good work life balance good career growth,sometime it can be overworked to meet deadlines
24,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Manager,2025-05-02,3.0,CEO is awesome. Bonus and pay is decent for roles. Some administrative roles pay too much though. Some divisional folks have expertise that are valuable.,"Corporate folks in Boston lack expertise and take large salaries. HR recruiment lacks ability to bring good candidates. Love the CEO but he did allow an unvetted runaway train with DEI... which became an individualized concept of a selfish few with an agenda to be forced upon the whole company. Company appeared to sell DEI, and not well, instead of medIcal devices. Subtantive work suffered due to it. It's odd anyone would think the agenda makes sense for business. Hopefully they get back on track. Social issues are best left out of the main business agenda unless the business goal is to solve them."
25,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Field clinical representative,2025-10-07,5.0,"Decent pay, excellent NY team","Pay could be higher given hours, weekends, and work load"
26,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Product builder,2025-08-25,2.0,Benefits are pretty good cost-wise 1st shift gives you the rest of the day to yourself,Terrible pay Their idea of DEI is a joke No one is ever on the same page; you ask one person a question and get a different answer when you ask someone else that's at the same level as them! Lots of favoritism at play when it comes to certain supervisors Don't rely on their word when they say an opportunity is in the future for you
27,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Manufacturing engineer,2025-09-12,1.0,"The engineers and product builders are not the issue, its upper management that has problems. All of the people I have interacted and worked with (on the engineering level) are genuinely nice and supportive. Everything is about saving money for the corporation, but not taking care of employees mentally or financially.",Just like any other corporation the management team has their favorites and HR turns a blind eye to anything reported against those people. Nobody is held accountable for their actions ethically or professionally.
28,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Pacemaker technician,2025-10-02,5.0,"Advancing tech field, good education for systems","Dealing with patient and Dr personalities, days can turn long unexpectedly"

31,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Senior group manager,2025-09-10,5.0,The culture at Boston Scientific is amazing. They (appropriately) focus on the patient above all. Second to that is the treatment of their employees. It is the best place that I've worked hands down.,Nothing comes to mind regarding cons.
32,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Senior manufacturing engineer,2025-10-03,3.0,The company has good benefits.,There is a lack of training.

36,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Project manager,2025-09-25,5.0,Lots of opportunities to advance and learn,"Somewhat hierarchical, can be lots of red tape"
37,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Senior clinical specialist,2025-07-26,4.0,The products are excellent and they sell themselves/ the sales training team arms you with the necessary materials to succeed,"Retention is terrible because leadership is disconnected from the field and punishes its hardest workers with more hard work. There is a lack of opportunity to make more money and so there is a tendency to see burnout right before someone reaches the end of their contract. When presented with a new contract opportunity, there is no offer to raise the base salary."
38,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Anonnymous,2025-09-19,5.0,Literally the best company out there. Always eager to help patients and progress further,"No words, absolutely great company!"

43,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Regulatory specialist,2025-08-18,1.0,Money and summer Friday flex time.,"The quality system is a house of horrors, both in that it was designed incorrectly and that management holds nonconformities and regulations back from being corrected/implemented through the quality system. Upper management purposely only reacts to external audit findings (such as by FDA, BSI). The internal audits are obviously weak, as glaring errors only continue to perpetuate and cause chaos. Management can't admit the obvious, they just continue with their shady and illogical informal rationales, provided verbally or in email."
44,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Internal comms and engagement,2025-04-21,5.0,"Working at this organization has been an incredibly rewarding experience. The supportive and collaborative environment created by my colleagues has made every day enjoyable and productive. The organization itself is well-structured and mission-driven, fostering a deep connection to its goals and values. One of the standout aspects is the robust support for professional development and career growth. There are numerous opportunities to learn, grow, and advance within the company, which has significantly contributed to my sense of belonging and commitment to the organization. Overall, the combination of great colleagues, a strong organizational mission, and ample development support makes this a fantastic place to build a career.","A potential con of working for a global organization is the complexity of navigating different cultural norms and communication styles. When working with global teams, employees may encounter varying expectations and practices, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or challenges in collaboration. Adapting to diverse work cultures requires sensitivity and flexibility, and it may take time to build effective working relationships across different regions."

52,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Field clinical representative,2025-09-08,1.0,None. Terrible overall experience. Promoting the wrong people,I had a manger run off an entire team and that individual was promoted. Terrible environment that ruined the entire company for me.
53,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Sr. r&d engineer,2025-08-21,4.0,Work culture is better than most places. Work-life balance. Most are friendly.,Don't work in the Valencia site. They are downsizing.

Awesome benefits and PTO.",Management is cliquey and not at a certain point you have to leave the company if you want to find advancement.
59,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Scrum master,2025-07-23,5.0,This industry has been stable where other industries right now are experiencing layoffs. Great work life balance.

65,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Marketing operations specialist,2025-08-04,3.0,Making a difference in the lives of patients.,"Lack of autonomy and flexibility, head count freezes, difficulty for growth."
66,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Project manager,2025-03-25,2.0,- Work schedule flexibility - Commitment to DE&I - Health benefits and maternity leave are average,"There have been multiple policy changes in the past year and a half by CEO, Mike Mahoney that have tanked the culture of Boston Scientific. If you were an existing remote employee, there are no longer any opportunities for you and it is a sign of quiet firing. Many teams are over capacity and expected to work long hours and that is embedded in the culture. You work until the work is done. There are many policies that are in place, including increased face-to-face meetings, which seems hypocritical with new travel policies. Recently the CEO’s salary has been released, and it reflects in the merit and bonuses that we’ve been awarded. It would not surprise me if in a couple of months, DE&I goes away."
67,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Process development engineer,2025-07-28,4.0,"Good people, oppurtunities to advance, promote high personal ethics","Beauracracy, internal gossip, project management"

70,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Digital marketing,2025-05-13,2.0,People you get to work with Salary is ok Bonus each year Impact of the company on patients Big company feel/perks Nice office and amenities,"Where to start. I loved this place up until a couple years ago. Management has turned into money crazy leaders where all that matters in sales. While that drives the business and investment, sales comes from humane operations and having time to think to build a great product. It takes great teams to do that, to emphasize that we need to make space to learn, be creative, think about what is important, to fail, to innovate, to grow. None of this is here anymore. Its about making the numbers look good - “seeing green” like i heard today. Everyone is under pressure to show growth no matter how its done. People take mental leaves, disappear from teams, you can visibly see the frustration on people, cracking under the pressure. Ive seen so many people come and go since management changed the culture. People are edged out, people silent quit. Everything is controlled by what one person thinks and the mood theyre in. Sunday scaries are real here now. Leaders will throw you under the bus and not pause to think about what you need from them to succeed just because they're constantly trying to please the upper management. You may be moving the earth and sky to get what they ask of you done and not get an inch of gratefulness or thank you- in fact they just move the bar and make you feel like you didnt reach it, change direction and not use your work at all that you stayed up all day and night doing to meet an out of the blue impossible deadline. Priorities dont shift around either, you need to make it work. This particular team has these problems but others have similar ones. Fear based leadership for this team which feels like worker bees holding up the team. You do make great friends as you share each others pain and hold each other up. I have no time to grow in my career at all as every second is taken up by work. 0 work life balance and actually bring home work and the stress, anxiety, and abuse with me."
71,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Field clinical specialist,2025-07-22,5.0,Wonderful company. Invests in employees continuous training and development. Good benefits as well,Not sure I have any cons

74,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Human resources,2025-01-23,4.0,Benefits Pto’s Perks 401k ESOP Daycare,"this is the most toxic workplace. Reeks of passive aggressive attitudes and entitled tenured grandpas and grandmas. Peers seem friendly but are manipulative, and petty. Some despite’ being tenured are clueless on company policies and “director “ titles make up for the sheer ignorance. Being in a people driven role, you are treated badly by internal leadership and employees, on certain situations. Leaders are reactive versus being mature. The benchmarking and data belongs to the 18th century and somehow is never competitive or accurate. Everyone is seemingly a part of project but outcomes are never tangible. TA onboarding operations all play to their own tunes and everyone seems disconnected."
75,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Continuous improvement specialist,2025-07-15,3.0,Diversity and Inclusivity. On-line trainings.,Too much politics and sugar coating.
76,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Clinical specialist,2025-03-09,1.0,A rewarding position that allows for employees to continuously improve their technical abilities. Good benefits as well.,"There is high turnover for a reason. There are plenty of two-faced people (including management) ready to take advantage of entry-level employees. To protect their idiocy, they will blame and target the new people (often the good talent) so that they aren't a threat to changing the toxic workplace culture. When good talent stands up for themselves, management will continue to use that against them to push them out the door. Not even just new employees, but other tenured people who aren't 'brown-nosers' or haven't formed alliances with the 'right' people are also subject to being undermined and targeted."
77,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Specialist,2025-07-29,5.0,Took great care of employees,Worked a lot of hours
78,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Principal software engineer,2025-07-25,5.0,"fair pay, slightly above market average",non i can think off
79,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Clinical evaluation scientist,2025-01-02,5.0,"-I'm sure this varies from department/team, but I've found my manager and coworkers to be very friendly and helpful. They genuinely want me to succeed in this position and are always willing to set aside time to answer any questions/provide training. -The overall onboarding program at Boston is very organized. Important links and HR information is readily available and easy to locate. -Company culture is very supportive -Unlimited sick-time for salaried employees -Hybrid work-mode and general flexibility -Employee programs for shopping discounts (Perks at Work) -Daycare available at some facilities","-Salaried employees still have to track their time -PTO accrued monthly rather than lump sum at start of year -No additional support for paying off past student loans. At Abbott Labs they will contribute 5% of your salary to your 401K if you're paying at least 2% of your salary towards student loans. This means that rather than paying your student loans and contributing to your 401K, Abbott encourages you to put more money towards your student loans and will add 5% of your salary into your 401k for FREE. -No health incentive programs for discounts to health plan."
80,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Crm field representative,2025-02-13,5.0,The training and field experience has been great. The teams I've been placed with have outstanding knowledge of CRM material and knowing the heart in and out. BS is a great company and work environment overall.,"The only con I have isn't necessarily with the company its just part of the employment status as a Per Diem. That's getting the proper time to work independently to really learn the trade. Also, there are no guarantees to get a full-time position if that's what your goal is it's up to timing and what the manager feels in the end so a good bit of unknowns with the per diem gig at least."
81,Boston Scientific,Healthcare,Senior cta,2025-06-03,4.0,"The overall company culture, swag, holidays, office space was all fantastic.","Pay was not aligned with market pay for the positions.

None. Unless you want the brand on your resume. Constant reorg, and I mean constant. On average, have had a new division lead every 12 months. Operational model keeps changing.

I enjoy that J&J has adapted as a large company to the demands of a modern workforce while keeping some of the tried and true cultural elements of a mature company. For example, incredibly generous time off, instead of ""unlimited PTO"". Territories are not unusually large for field teams and they are growing their patient support options through acquisitions of patient support hubs. The different teams work hard to make sure folks in different functions are supported. Such as national contracts are in place quickly and we feel the results downstream on a local level, or we can reach out to people in different functions to have candid conversations about what isn't happening that we've been told to expect. There's a great amount of partnership that's possible if you're willing to reach out. That part of the company culture is great to be a part of.","While the company has made huge strides by purchasing the PSC (Patient Service Center) and integrating the company's personnel as J&J employees, they are a sub par hub with training lapses. Many of the interactions I have with them lack accountability and professionalism. I think this hub would benefit from a different model and increased incentivization to perform at a higher level for patients. I worry what patients experience when relying on the PSC for information regarding their treatments and I often do not feel our hub counterparts are genuinely our partners who understand the responsibility they have to produce results for patients."

The company normalizes checking emails and answering texts during vacation. Always on culture, no downtime between conferences and field work. The company recently changed metrics and treats the MSL team like sales— prioritizing specific sales focused data. They have every TA team working with the same data and having the same targets. There is excessive priority given to ‘falling in line’ over skills and talent. Be ready to give up your life meeting the job demands for ungrateful leadership.

I also had the opportunity to work with really smart people.,"My manager was a Shared Services manager with no concept of IT or Security so she was not able to give me the support I needed to understand and collaborate on my role responsibilities. As a result, she managed based on meaningless tasks and how many hours she could get me to spend on them. She didn't understand that 10+ programs was too many for 1 person to fully understand, and maintain. Security was not centralized within the company so different departments were doing different things with no collaboration. Security was not taken seriously. Managers wanted to do the least and have me sign off on whatever. I had numerous privacy concerns that were part of their minimum security requirements that were not addressed.

There’s a clear pattern of favoritism and racial bias — white colleagues were promoted within months, while others were overlooked repeatedly regardless of performance or qualifications. When I was approved for a secondment opportunity, my department in Cambridge refused to release me, only to ask me later to find my own replacement. After I did, they delayed interviewing the candidate until my secondment opportunity had expired — and then hired that same person into my old role. Despite consistently meeting expectations, I received a poor performance review for reasons unrelated to my work, such as “not being in the lab enough,” even though management itself failed to provide direction or support. This department operates with poor leadership, zero accountability, and a culture that damages mental health. If you value fairness, growth, and respect, stay away."

416,GSK,Healthcare,Technical service representative,2025-08-01,2.0,"There is really only one pro and that is the compensation and benefits are decent, certainly not a leader in the field, but decent.","Where to begin... GSK as a company is an after thought among larger industry players, their pipeline is weak, they haven't experienced significant growth in decades, and recent acquisitions suggest poor purchases and capital allocation. Structurally, there is significant bureaucracy in this company that is a death knell to innovation and efficiencies, there are many layers of middle management with countless directors, associate managers, and other fancy sounding titles. I worked at for this company for many years and I still don't know what many of these positions did and many seemed either redundant or highly specialized. When it comes to hiring individuals, there seems to be an incredible lack of attention on meaningful skill and capabilities, and more emphasis on diversity and value... which frankly is so hypocritical because this company holds a record for one the largest fines in US history related to their marketing practices and integrity. Competitors seem to be bounding ahead and no one in the company that has any kind of important role seems to offer a strategy or solution. It becomes very tiresome to listen to these people talk, but never do. If you want an okay salary and you can be easily convinced of ""great things to come"", by all means give this company a go, but make sure to bring you Excedrin because you will quickly start wondering how any of the people running this circus got their roles. If you do happen to end up working for this company, you will probably have two possible career paths. The most likely is a string of rejections, failed attempts, and being told how important you are without ever advancing. The less likely path is that the cohort of dunderheads see themselves in you, salute your perceived greatness, and usher you into their special club of world-changing disrupters that benefit from titles, but not brains. This company is so built on a foundation of nonsense that it will either implode or languish against its peers for future decades. If you end up working here, it will likely be just a job and not a career. You have yourself to blame if you choose to work here."

Incredible mountainous location for outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy.","Due to the company's policies regarding performance improvement, chronic underperformers are allowed to stay with the company for many years in some cases. People make the company, so getting rid of poor performers needs to be more of a priority. Additional vacation time is not awarded until an employee has been with the company for 10 years. An entire decade before offering a PTO bump is too long. 15 days per year is the standard vacation offering. This could be improved."

502,Mayo Clinic,Healthcare,Clinical research coordinator,2025-10-18,1.0,The pay is better than some CRC positions.,"You do not get paid holidays. You either use PTO or if you do not have it. Get unpaid and sick pay is also deducted from your PTO. That is the only time you can use no pay. If you are sick with no PTO and use unpaid. You will get an occurrence after a fee is a write up and then fire. Leadership are all young fresh never been supervisors in their 30s max. They were CRCs in the same department before promoting so favoritism shows. No support and will deflect and throw CRCs under the bus to the doctors on the study. No communication. A policy changes and you get reprimanded for not doing it the new way, when it was never mentioned it changed. Even asking the whole office and everyone was also unaware. You be given way too much of a workload and get questioned why a study may be lacking when you are given 10 studies to oversee. Turn over rate is insane so the studies the person had that left is given to someone with not enough time to handle. Coverage to take off is a mess. The name Mayo is enticing. Not worth it. I’d gladly take less an hour and not deal with the stress."
503,Mayo Clinic,Healthcare,Sonographer,2025-08-21,3.0,"Lots of education from peers and physicians. They give you lots of free food to forget about how underpaid you are. This review is based on if you’re not a physician, the quality of life for physicians and exempt staff is exceptionally better than for hourly staff. The patient care can be better but also can be worse than other hospitals but the communication between consultants and support staff is objectively better here than other places I’ve been.","Low pay, horrible insurance, low PTO in comparison with other hospitals. Retirement benefits are meh, it’s a 2.5% 403b match (50% on 5%), the 401a/pension is an embarrassment and honestly isn’t worth your time unless you’re starting out young and planning on dying here and living in a trailer during retirement. Also with it being such a large hospital, opportunities for career growth and advancement are quite limited. They stick you in one role and that’s literally all you do. There are also almost no options for education, you have to do their arbitrary career investment program where you literally write a paragraph and they arbitrarily decide if they will fund your education or not. The long short, come here to learn then leave. If you’ve stayed here past four years you’ve been impacted by wage compression where new hires are making more."
504,Mayo Clinic,Healthcare,Anonymous employee,2025-08-14,4.0,"Mayo Clinic is deeply committed to patient care. Everyone working here prioritizes the needs of the patient above all else. Team members across different roles treat each other with respect and professionalism. Staff parking is provided free of charge onsite. The three shields at Mayo represent research, education, and patient care. Many staff members are actively involved in all three areas, making meaningful contributions to the medical community. A complimentary treat trolley occasionally visits units, offering candy and other sweets for staff to enjoy. Having Mayo Clinic on your résumé is a valuable career milestone, as it is recognized as one of the top hospitals in the world.","The health insurance benefits could be more competitive given Mayo Clinic’s reputation. For example, there is no $0 deductible plan option, premiums remain relatively high, and employees must request their own insurance card directly from the insurance provider. Paid parental leave is currently limited to two weeks. The Minnesota paid parental leave program, which offers up to 20 weeks of paid maternity leave and 12 weeks of paid paternity leave, has not yet been fully implemented. Parking availability can be challenging, particularly during peak hours. Although Mayo states its compensation is competitive, salaries are determined by a strict scale based on years of experience in the profession. In some cases, this can result in significant pay reductions compared to prior roles, such as a $60,000 decrease in pay. There are no unions for nurses or other professions, and the organization actively works to maintain a non-unionized workforce."
505,Mayo Clinic,Healthcare,Patient care assistant (pca),2025-10-06,2.0,Good pay for a part time job Good co-workers (for the most part) Good experience to put on resume,"Management set unrealistic expectations for nursing staff on unit. Units were constantly intentionally understaffed which caused safety issues for both staff and patients. Would get yelled at for sitting down for more than 30 seconds or using the bathroom during an 8-12 hour shift because the unit was so overworked. This was not an issue for every unit, but unfortunately was for the one I worked on. Additionally, safety of staff was neglected constantly and 'taking; physical abuse from patients was the 'norm', even when it was brought up to management, we would be reprimanded for this. Finally, the sick call-in policy also put patients and co workers at risk. Staff could not call in sick (with contagious diseases) if they already did a few times before in the year-- or they would be at risk of losing their job."

512,Mayo Clinic,Healthcare,Postdoctoral research associate,2025-06-24,5.0,"Prestigious Institution: Internationally recognized for medical excellence and innovation, Mayo Clinic adds strong credibility to your CV. Access to Clinical Data: Unique opportunity to work with high-quality, de-identified patient data, especially beneficial for researchers in AI, imaging, or bioinformatics. Collaborative Environment: Interdisciplinary culture encourages collaboration between clinicians, scientists, and engineers. Strong Research Infrastructure: Robust support systems, including access to biostatistics, IRB assistance, research computing, and administrative support. Focus on Translational Impact: Projects are often clinically relevant and aimed at real-world implementation, which is rewarding for applied researchers. Internal Funding Opportunities: Postdocs can apply for intramural seed grants and are often encouraged to submit K99/R00 or equivalent career development awards. Excellent Work-Life Balance: Compared to other high-pressure research institutions, Mayo often promotes a healthier and more humane research culture.","Limited Academic Networking: Rochester and Phoenix campuses can feel geographically isolated from larger academic ecosystems, which may limit seminar diversity or visiting speaker series. Variable PI Mentorship: Experience heavily depends on your mentor. Some labs offer strong guidance and career development; others are more hands-off. Transition to Faculty May Be Limited: Few internal postdocs are promoted directly to faculty roles; career progression often requires moving institutions. Bureaucracy: As a large healthcare organization, navigating institutional policies, compliance, and data access protocols can be slow and frustrating. Salary Considerations: While above NIH minimums, compensation may still lag behind tech industry roles or more competitive postdoc positions in industry-aligned labs."

It's clear that productivity second to publicity in all aspects of the science being done. They exploit foreign workers for cheap labor in exchange for an empty experience that looks good on paper, but is a waste of time in reality. Science is treated as a lower class of worker to the healthcare side, and it's clear the only purpose of science according to leadership at mayo is to generate headlines, and receive donations from well meaning but ignorant people. The culture of ""Mayo is the best at everything"" gets creepy when you are working in an area that Mayo is clearly not very good at. Feels very Orwellian in combination with HR being so aggressive."

Its stellar reputation and compelling mission were incredibly appealing, and I even accepted a lower total compensation package, driven by the prospect of contributing to a positive societal impact. I truly believed I could make a difference here. However, my actual experience has been quite different from those initial hopes. I work within an area often described as a ""platform,"" which initially seemed poised to be the future of healthcare, with the potential to dramatically improve patient outcomes. Unfortunately, this vision remains largely unrealized. Much of this can be attributed to the leadership at various levels, especially with the Mayo CEO and COO of my group. There's a palpable sense of internal pressure that often feels artificial, contributing to a generally difficult work environment. The organizational culture, at least within my domain, appears to be heavily influenced by fear, where deference to the COOs authority is often rewarded over contributions. Challenging the status quo, even when justified, will carry significant repercussions. This is particularly problematic when valid points are raised, as they can be perceived as threats by those in leadership positions. For example, there's a clear lack of strategic direction, evident in the sheer number of ""priorities"" that are simultaneously juggled – it's difficult to see how the 70th item on a list can genuinely be considered a priority. This highlights a significant disconnect in setting and executing clear objectives. While there are some talented individuals in leadership roles, it feels like many struggle to effectively manage upward when faced with less competent authority. Having worked in tech, I believe many of these leaders would be eaten up by standard directors at most tech companies. To focus a bit more on the COO, it's apparent to all that he has limited operational knowledge and seems to have achieved their position through aggressive interpersonal dynamics. He consistently undermines colleagues in public discussions. What follows is typically a frustrating cycle of criticism without any practical advice, leaving teams without a clear path forward. He is consistently proven wrong, but feels like he is either too dense to acknowledge he was wrong or has made a career of just continuing to belittle people in the hope they do not dare call him on it. Despite these challenges, there are truly exceptional individuals within the organization, particularly among the doctors working with the ""platform."" Interacting with the doctors has been inspiring, and their dedication is undeniable. My only observation is a desire for stronger advocacy from them against operational inefficiencies, especially concerning the COO, who lacks both relevant medical and technical expertise. Overall, I'm give this organization a 2-star rating. My respect for many of the individuals here, especially the medical professionals, and the inherent potential of the mission keep it from being a 1. However, for those in non-medical roles (or medical roles but devote most of their time to this team), the experience will be frustrating. There's a possibility for significant improvement, particularly with future leadership changes, but whether it's worth waiting to see that unfold, or joining before such changes occur, is a significant consideration."

They bulk hire PCAs without telling you you'll be a glorified float/sitter pool. RN staffing is super good so they have little use for axillary assistance. I was told I'd have a ""small"" float role which ensued for long periods of time (I wouldn't see the ICU for months, consistently). This is an ongoing issue that has gone on for years.

Upper management purposely only reacts to external audit findings (such as by FDA, BSI). The internal audits are obviously weak, as glaring errors only continue to perpetuate and cause chaos.

There are many policies that are in place, including increased face-to-face meetings, which seems hypocritical with new travel policies.

I loved this place up until a couple years ago. Management has turned into money crazy leaders where all that matters in sales. While that drives the business and investment, sales comes from humane operations and having time to think to build a great product. It takes great teams to do that, to emphasize that we need to make space to learn, be creative, think about what is important, to fail, to innovate, to grow. None of this is here anymore. Its about making the numbers look good - “seeing green” like i heard today. Everyone is under pressure to show growth no matter how its done. People take mental leaves, disappear from teams, you can visibly see the frustration on people, cracking under the pressure. Ive seen so many people come and go since management changed the culture. People are edged out, people silent quit. Everything is controlled by what one person thinks and the mood theyre in. Sunday scaries are real here now. Leaders will throw you under the bus and not pause to think about what you need from them to succeed just because they're constantly trying to please the upper management. You may be moving the earth and sky to get what they ask of you done and not get an inch of gratefulness or thank you- in fact they just move the bar and make you feel like you didnt reach it, change direction and not use your work at all that you stayed up all day and night doing to meet an out of the blue impossible deadline. Priorities dont shift around either, you need to make it work. This particular team has these problems but others have similar ones. Fear based leadership for this team which feels like worker bees holding up the team. You do make great friends as you share each others pain and hold each other up. I have no time to grow in my career at all as every second is taken up by work. 0 work life balance and actually bring home work and the stress, anxiety, and abuse with me."

To protect their idiocy, they will blame and target the new people (often the good talent) so that they aren't a threat to changing the toxic workplace culture. When good talent stands up for themselves, management will continue to use that against them to push them out the door.

886,Johnson & Johnson,Healthcare,Field reimbursement manager,2025-07-24,5.0,"I love working for J&J for multiple reasons. I enjoy that J&J has adapted as a large company to the demands of a modern workforce while keeping some of the tried and true cultural elements of a mature company. For example, incredibly generous time off, instead of ""unlimited PTO"". Territories are not unusually large for field teams and they are growing their patient support options through acquisitions of patient support hubs. The different teams work hard to make sure folks in different functions are supported. Such as national contracts are in place quickly and we feel the results downstream on a local level, or we can reach out to people in different functions to have candid conversations about what isn't happening that we've been told to expect. There's a great amount of partnership that's possible if you're willing to reach out. That part of the company culture is great to be a part of.","While the company has made huge strides by purchasing the PSC (Patient Service Center) and integrating the company's personnel as J&J employees, they are a sub par hub with training lapses. Many of the interactions I have with them lack accountability and professionalism. I think this hub would benefit from a different model and increased incentivization to perform at a higher level for patients. I worry what patients experience when relying on the PSC for information regarding their treatments and I often do not feel our hub counterparts are genuinely our partners who understand the responsibility they have to produce results for patients."

Salary ends up being much less than they state, after considering: uncompensated industry-standard reimbursement, excessive taxing of anything they consider a benefit and the 3 year cliff on the total package comps (stocks, match, etc). The company normalizes checking emails and answering texts during vacation. Always on culture, no downtime between conferences and field work. The company recently changed metrics and treats the MSL team like sales— prioritizing specific sales focused data. They have every TA team working with the same data and having the same targets. There is excessive priority given to ‘falling in line’ over skills and talent. Be ready to give up your life meeting the job demands for ungrateful leadership.

I'm guessing this is because they are not a U.S. originated company. I also had the opportunity to work with really smart people.,"My manager was a Shared Services manager with no concept of IT or Security so she was not able to give me the support I needed to understand and collaborate on my role responsibilities. As a result, she managed based on meaningless tasks and how many hours she could get me to spend on them. She didn't understand that 10+ programs was too many for 1 person to fully understand, and maintain. Security was not centralized within the company so different departments were doing different things with no collaboration. Security was not taken seriously. Managers wanted to do the least and have me sign off on whatever. I had numerous privacy concerns that were part of their minimum security requirements that were not addressed. The company hasn't adopted a framework they plan to stick to. Overall, I felt like the fall person for when they eventually have a major breach or fall out with some privacy law like GDPR."

There’s a clear pattern of favoritism and racial bias — white colleagues were promoted within months, while others were overlooked repeatedly regardless of performance or qualifications. When I was approved for a secondment opportunity, my department in Cambridge refused to release me, only to ask me later to find my own replacement. After I did, they delayed interviewing the candidate until my secondment opportunity had expired — and then hired that same person into my old role. Despite consistently meeting expectations, I received a poor performance review for reasons unrelated to my work, such as “not being in the lab enough,” even though management itself failed to provide direction or support. This department operates with poor leadership, zero accountability, and a culture that damages mental health. If you value fairness, growth, and respect, stay away."
1002,GSK,Healthcare,Manufacturing associate,2025-11-17,4.0,Worked with good people and got the job done. GSK provided a good seperation.,The product needs further development so manufacturing is exiting the site.

1012,GSK,Healthcare,Technical service representative,2025-08-01,2.0,"There is really only one pro and that is the compensation and benefits are decent, certainly not a leader in the field, but decent.","Where to begin... GSK as a company is an after thought among larger industry players, their pipeline is weak, they haven't experienced significant growth in decades, and recent acquisitions suggest poor purchases and capital allocation. Structurally, there is significant bureaucracy in this company that is a death knell to innovation and efficiencies, there are many layers of middle management with countless directors, associate managers, and other fancy sounding titles. I worked at for this company for many years and I still don't know what many of these positions did and many seemed either redundant or highly specialized. When it comes to hiring individuals, there seems to be an incredible lack of attention on meaningful skill and capabilities, and more emphasis on diversity and value... which frankly is so hypocritical because this company holds a record for one the largest fines in US history related to their marketing practices and integrity. Competitors seem to be bounding ahead and no one in the company that has any kind of important role seems to offer a strategy or solution. It becomes very tiresome to listen to these people talk, but never do. If you want an okay salary and you can be easily convinced of ""great things to come"", by all means give this company a go, but make sure to bring you Excedrin because you will quickly start wondering how any of the people running this circus got their roles. If you do happen to end up working for this company, you will probably have two possible career paths. The most likely is a string of rejections, failed attempts, and being told how important you are without ever advancing. The less likely path is that the cohort of dunderheads see themselves in you, salute your perceived greatness, and usher you into their special club of world-changing disrupters that benefit from titles, but not brains. This company is so built on a foundation of nonsense that it will either implode or languish against its peers for future decades. If you end up working here, it will likely be just a job and not a career. You have yourself to blame if you choose to work here."

Typically, money and/or budgets are not a huge concern either.","Despite GSK's large network, it is remarkably disorganized and chaotic.

Incredible mountainous location for outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy.","Due to the company's policies regarding performance improvement, chronic underperformers are allowed to stay with the company for many years in some cases. People make the company, so getting rid of poor performers needs to be more of a priority. Additional vacation time is not awarded until an employee has been with the company for 10 years.

1116,Mayo Clinic,Healthcare,Postdoctoral research associate,2025-06-24,5.0,"Prestigious Institution: Internationally recognized for medical excellence and innovation, Mayo Clinic adds strong credibility to your CV. Access to Clinical Data: Unique opportunity to work with high-quality, de-identified patient data, especially beneficial for researchers in AI, imaging, or bioinformatics. Collaborative Environment: Interdisciplinary culture encourages collaboration between clinicians, scientists, and engineers. Strong Research Infrastructure: Robust support systems, including access to biostatistics, IRB assistance, research computing, and administrative support. Focus on Translational Impact: Projects are often clinically relevant and aimed at real-world implementation, which is rewarding for applied researchers. Internal Funding Opportunities: Postdocs can apply for intramural seed grants and are often encouraged to submit K99/R00 or equivalent career development awards. Excellent Work-Life Balance: Compared to other high-pressure research institutions, Mayo often promotes a healthier and more humane research culture.","Limited Academic Networking: Rochester and Phoenix campuses can feel geographically isolated from larger academic ecosystems, which may limit seminar diversity or visiting speaker series. Variable PI Mentorship: Experience heavily depends on your mentor. Some labs offer strong guidance and career development; others are more hands-off. Transition to Faculty May Be Limited: Few internal postdocs are promoted directly to faculty roles; career progression often requires moving institutions. Bureaucracy: As a large healthcare organization, navigating institutional policies, compliance, and data access protocols can be slow and frustrating. Salary Considerations: While above NIH minimums, compensation may still lag behind tech industry roles or more competitive postdoc positions in industry-aligned labs."

Its stellar reputation and compelling mission were incredibly appealing, and I even accepted a lower total compensation package, driven by the prospect of contributing to a positive societal impact. I truly believed I could make a difference here. However, my actual experience has been quite different from those initial hopes. I work within an area often described as a ""platform,"" which initially seemed poised to be the future of healthcare, with the potential to dramatically improve patient outcomes. Unfortunately, this vision remains largely unrealized. Much of this can be attributed to the leadership at various levels, especially with the Mayo CEO and COO of my group. There's a palpable sense of internal pressure that often feels artificial, contributing to a generally difficult work environment. The organizational culture, at least within my domain, appears to be heavily influenced by fear, where deference to the COOs authority is often rewarded over contributions. Challenging the status quo, even when justified, will carry significant repercussions. This is particularly problematic when valid points are raised, as they can be perceived as threats by those in leadership positions. For example, there's a clear lack of strategic direction, evident in the sheer number of ""priorities"" that are simultaneously juggled – it's difficult to see how the 70th item on a list can genuinely be considered a priority. This highlights a significant disconnect in setting and executing clear objectives. While there are some talented individuals in leadership roles, it feels like many struggle to effectively manage upward when faced with less competent authority. Having worked in tech, I believe many of these leaders would be eaten up by standard directors at most tech companies. To focus a bit more on the COO, it's apparent to all that he has limited operational knowledge and seems to have achieved their position through aggressive interpersonal dynamics. He consistently undermines colleagues in public discussions. What follows is typically a frustrating cycle of criticism without any practical advice, leaving teams without a clear path forward. He is consistently proven wrong, but feels like he is either too dense to acknowledge he was wrong or has made a career of just continuing to belittle people in the hope they do not dare call him on it. Despite these challenges, there are truly exceptional individuals within the organization, particularly among the doctors working with the ""platform."" Interacting with the doctors has been inspiring, and their dedication is undeniable. My only observation is a desire for stronger advocacy from them against operational inefficiencies, especially concerning the COO, who lacks both relevant medical and technical expertise. Overall, I'm give this organization a 2-star rating. My respect for many of the individuals here, especially the medical professionals, and the inherent potential of the mission keep it from being a 1. However, for those in non-medical roles (or medical roles but devote most of their time to this team), the experience will be frustrating. There's a possibility for significant improvement, particularly with future leadership changes, but whether it's worth waiting to see that unfold, or joining before such changes occur, is a significant consideration."

Unless you're willing to wait your time and move up, but remember, there are so many people trying to get out of this position. 1 year and 8 months before you can be promoted or switch roles. Basically, you have to jump hoops to get promoted, as you not only have to go above and beyond in your job but also pick up extra projects. Depending on what process day you are in, there is a vast difference in schedules, such as the amount of time in the C space environment."
1192,Mayo Clinic,Healthcare,Patient care assistant (pca),2025-04-30,2.0,- Well staffed - Work load as an ICU PCA was always manageable - Clean and well kept,"If you're a PCA, don't apply at their ICU. They bulk hire PCAs without telling you you'll be a glorified float/sitter pool. RN staffing is super good so they have little use for axillary assistance. I was told I'd have a ""small"" float role which ensued for long periods of time (I wouldn't see the ICU for months, consistently). This is an ongoing issue that has gone on for years. If you want actual critical care experience, go literally anywhere else in Phoenix! There are many other issues in the ICU here as a PCA, but just know if you take this advice you'll dodge a bullet."
1193,Pfizer,Healthcare,Senior leader,2025-04-06,1.0,"No pros, just a lot of cons, specially at this site. All older employees have their kids and family working in other departments. The number of politics at this facility is nonsensical and highly toxic due to legacy employees. Every SLT member has a son or daughter working in the company and by passing processes. doing nothing and minting money. Management is toxic within the plant and specially above site. They have layoffs every other year so everyone lives in fear. During my time there did not meet one single person who has any good thing to say about anything.","Perhaps they get the award for being the the most miserable vial work environment for all levels in the organization, High attrition rates and low pay are the hallmarks, new employees dont see their supervisors for weeks. The previous site head was a unprofessional coward and a racist leader. Created an enviroment of fear, favoritism, and nepotism, He was endorsed by his superiors so this is company culture. I dont think there are any good people there, majority are incompetent people who now have their children and family working here too."
1194,Johnson & Johnson,Healthcare,Medical science liaison (msl),2025-03-10,2.0,It’s a job. There is decent market stability,"Comparative to the market, the compensation package is Mediocre for their asks. Salary ends up being much less than they state, after considering: uncompensated industry-standard reimbursement, excessive taxing of anything they consider a benefit and the 3 year cliff on the total package comps (stocks, match, etc). The company normalizes checking emails and answering texts during vacation. Always on culture, no downtime between conferences and field work. The company recently changed metrics and treats the MSL team like sales— prioritizing specific sales focused data. They have every TA team working with the same data and having the same targets. There is excessive priority given to ‘falling in line’ over skills and talent. Be ready to give up your life meeting the job demands for ungrateful leadership. The organization operates like a private high school sports team. Sure, there a few good players here and there, but most of them are C players with a superiority complex. This is a culture of mediocrity and stagnation."
1195,Roche,Healthcare,Cyber security sme,2024-01-11,2.0,The benefits were awesome. I used the maternity leave and I really appreciated being out for 12 weeks instead of the traditional 6 weeks. I'm guessing this is because they are not a U.S. originated company. I also had the opportunity to work with really smart people.,"My manager was a Shared Services manager with no concept of IT or Security so she was not able to give me the support I needed to understand and collaborate on my role responsibilities. As a result, she managed based on meaningless tasks and how many hours she could get me to spend on them. She didn't understand that 10+ programs was too many for 1 person to fully understand, and maintain. Security was not centralized within the company so different departments were doing different things with no collaboration. Security was not taken seriously. Managers wanted to do the least and have me sign off on whatever. I had numerous privacy concerns that were part of their minimum security requirements that were not addressed. The company hasn't adopted a framework they plan to stick to. Overall, I felt like the fall person for when they eventually have a major breach or fall out with some privacy law like GDPR."

Also with it being such a large hospital, opportunities for career growth and advancement are quite limited. They stick you in one role and that’s literally all you do. There are also almost no options for education, you have to do their arbitrary career investment program where you literally write a paragraph and they arbitrarily decide if they will fund your education or not.

The three shields at Mayo represent research, education, and patient care. Many staff members are actively involved in all three areas, making meaningful contributions to the medical community. A complimentary treat trolley occasionally visits units, offering candy and other sweets for staff to enjoy. Having Mayo Clinic on your résumé is a valuable career milestone, as it is recognized as one of the top hospitals in the world.","The health insurance benefits could be more competitive given Mayo Clinic’s reputation. For example, there is no $0 deductible plan option, premiums remain relatively high, and employees must request their own insurance card directly from the insurance provider. Paid parental leave is currently limited to two weeks. The Minnesota paid parental leave program, which offers up to 20 weeks of paid maternity leave and 12 weeks of paid paternity leave, has not yet been fully implemented. Parking availability can be challenging, particularly during peak hours. Although Mayo states its compensation is competitive, salaries are determined by a strict scale based on years of experience in the profession. In some cases, this can result in significant pay reductions compared to prior roles, such as a $60,000 decrease in pay.

It's clear that productivity second to publicity in all aspects of the science being done. They exploit foreign workers for cheap labor in exchange for an empty experience that looks good on paper, but is a waste of time in reality. Science is treated as a lower class of worker to the healthcare side, and it's clear the only purpose of science according to leadership at mayo is to generate headlines, and receive donations from well meaning but ignorant people. The culture of ""Mayo is the best at everything"" gets creepy when you are working in an area that Mayo is clearly not very good at. Feels very Orwellian in combination with HR being so aggressive."

When I was approved for a secondment opportunity, my department in Cambridge refused to release me, only to ask me later to find my own replacement. After I did, they delayed interviewing the candidate until my secondment opportunity had expired — and then hired that same person into my old role. Despite consistently meeting expectations, I received a poor performance review for reasons unrelated to my work, such as “not being in the lab enough,” even though management itself failed to provide direction or support.
