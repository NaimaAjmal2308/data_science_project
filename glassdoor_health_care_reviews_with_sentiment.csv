Its about making the numbers look good - “seeing green” like i heard today. Everyone is under pressure to show growth no matter how its done. People take mental leaves, disappear from teams, you can visibly see the frustration on people, cracking under the pressure. Ive seen so many people come and go since management changed the culture. People are edged out, people silent quit. Everything is controlled by what one person thinks and the mood theyre in. Sunday scaries are real here now. Leaders will throw you under the bus and not pause to think about what you need from them to succeed just because they're constantly trying to please the upper management. You may be moving the earth and sky to get what they ask of you done and not get an inch of gratefulness or thank you- in fact they just move the bar and make you feel like you didnt reach it, change direction and not use your work at all that you stayed up all day and night doing to meet an out of the blue impossible deadline. Priorities dont shift around either, you need to make it work. This particular team has these problems but others have similar ones. Fear based leadership for this team which feels like worker bees holding up the team. You do make great friends as you share each others pain and hold each other up.

I enjoy that J&J has adapted as a large company to the demands of a modern workforce while keeping some of the tried and true cultural elements of a mature company. For example, incredibly generous time off, instead of ""unlimited PTO"". Territories are not unusually large for field teams and they are growing their patient support options through acquisitions of patient support hubs. The different teams work hard to make sure folks in different functions are supported. Such as national contracts are in place quickly and we feel the results downstream on a local level, or we can reach out to people in different functions to have candid conversations about what isn't happening that we've been told to expect. There's a great amount of partnership that's possible if you're willing to reach out. That part of the company culture is great to be a part of.","While the company has made huge strides by purchasing the PSC (Patient Service Center) and integrating the company's personnel as J&J employees, they are a sub par hub with training lapses. Many of the interactions I have with them lack accountability and professionalism. I think this hub would benefit from a different model and increased incentivization to perform at a higher level for patients.

I'm guessing this is because they are not a U.S. originated company. I also had the opportunity to work with really smart people.,"My manager was a Shared Services manager with no concept of IT or Security so she was not able to give me the support I needed to understand and collaborate on my role responsibilities. As a result, she managed based on meaningless tasks and how many hours she could get me to spend on them. She didn't understand that 10+ programs was too many for 1 person to fully understand, and maintain. Security was not centralized within the company so different departments were doing different things with no collaboration. Security was not taken seriously. Managers wanted to do the least and have me sign off on whatever. I had numerous privacy concerns that were part of their minimum security requirements that were not addressed. The company hasn't adopted a framework they plan to stick to.

There’s a clear pattern of favoritism and racial bias — white colleagues were promoted within months, while others were overlooked repeatedly regardless of performance or qualifications. When I was approved for a secondment opportunity, my department in Cambridge refused to release me, only to ask me later to find my own replacement. After I did, they delayed interviewing the candidate until my secondment opportunity had expired — and then hired that same person into my old role. Despite consistently meeting expectations, I received a poor performance review for reasons unrelated to my work, such as “not being in the lab enough,” even though management itself failed to provide direction or support.

GSK as a company is an after thought among larger industry players, their pipeline is weak, they haven't experienced significant growth in decades, and recent acquisitions suggest poor purchases and capital allocation. Structurally, there is significant bureaucracy in this company that is a death knell to innovation and efficiencies, there are many layers of middle management with countless directors, associate managers, and other fancy sounding titles. I worked at for this company for many years and I still don't know what many of these positions did and many seemed either redundant or highly specialized. When it comes to hiring individuals, there seems to be an incredible lack of attention on meaningful skill and capabilities, and more emphasis on diversity and value... which frankly is so hypocritical because this company holds a record for one the largest fines in US history related to their marketing practices and integrity. Competitors seem to be bounding ahead and no one in the company that has any kind of important role seems to offer a strategy or solution. It becomes very tiresome to listen to these people talk, but never do. If you want an okay salary and you can be easily convinced of ""great things to come"", by all means give this company a go, but make sure to bring you Excedrin because you will quickly start wondering how any of the people running this circus got their roles. If you do happen to end up working for this company, you will probably have two possible career paths. The most likely is a string of rejections, failed attempts, and being told how important you are without ever advancing. The less likely path is that the cohort of dunderheads see themselves in you, salute your perceived greatness, and usher you into their special club of world-changing disrupters that benefit from titles, but not brains. This company is so built on a foundation of nonsense that it will either implode or languish against its peers for future decades.

The Minnesota paid parental leave program, which offers up to 20 weeks of paid maternity leave and 12 weeks of paid paternity leave, has not yet been fully implemented. Parking availability can be challenging, particularly during peak hours. Although Mayo states its compensation is competitive, salaries are determined by a strict scale based on years of experience in the profession.

Its stellar reputation and compelling mission were incredibly appealing, and I even accepted a lower total compensation package, driven by the prospect of contributing to a positive societal impact. I truly believed I could make a difference here. However, my actual experience has been quite different from those initial hopes. I work within an area often described as a ""platform,"" which initially seemed poised to be the future of healthcare, with the potential to dramatically improve patient outcomes. Unfortunately, this vision remains largely unrealized. Much of this can be attributed to the leadership at various levels, especially with the Mayo CEO and COO of my group. There's a palpable sense of internal pressure that often feels artificial, contributing to a generally difficult work environment. The organizational culture, at least within my domain, appears to be heavily influenced by fear, where deference to the COOs authority is often rewarded over contributions. Challenging the status quo, even when justified, will carry significant repercussions. This is particularly problematic when valid points are raised, as they can be perceived as threats by those in leadership positions. For example, there's a clear lack of strategic direction, evident in the sheer number of ""priorities"" that are simultaneously juggled – it's difficult to see how the 70th item on a list can genuinely be considered a priority. This highlights a significant disconnect in setting and executing clear objectives. While there are some talented individuals in leadership roles, it feels like many struggle to effectively manage upward when faced with less competent authority. Having worked in tech, I believe many of these leaders would be eaten up by standard directors at most tech companies. To focus a bit more on the COO, it's apparent to all that he has limited operational knowledge and seems to have achieved their position through aggressive interpersonal dynamics. He consistently undermines colleagues in public discussions. What follows is typically a frustrating cycle of criticism without any practical advice, leaving teams without a clear path forward. He is consistently proven wrong, but feels like he is either too dense to acknowledge he was wrong or has made a career of just continuing to belittle people in the hope they do not dare call him on it. Despite these challenges, there are truly exceptional individuals within the organization, particularly among the doctors working with the ""platform."" Interacting with the doctors has been inspiring, and their dedication is undeniable. My only observation is a desire for stronger advocacy from them against operational inefficiencies, especially concerning the COO, who lacks both relevant medical and technical expertise. Overall, I'm give this organization a 2-star rating. My respect for many of the individuals here, especially the medical professionals, and the inherent potential of the mission keep it from being a 1. However, for those in non-medical roles (or medical roles but devote most of their time to this team), the experience will be frustrating. There's a possibility for significant improvement, particularly with future leadership changes, but whether it's worth waiting to see that unfold, or joining before such changes occur, is a significant consideration.",0.8957,Positive,0.9823,Positive,0.9390000000000001,Positive

I loved this place up until a couple years ago. Management has turned into money crazy leaders where all that matters in sales. While that drives the business and investment, sales comes from humane operations and having time to think to build a great product. It takes great teams to do that, to emphasize that we need to make space to learn, be creative, think about what is important, to fail, to innovate, to grow. None of this is here anymore. Its about making the numbers look good - “seeing green” like i heard today. Everyone is under pressure to show growth no matter how its done. People take mental leaves, disappear from teams, you can visibly see the frustration on people, cracking under the pressure. Ive seen so many people come and go since management changed the culture. People are edged out, people silent quit. Everything is controlled by what one person thinks and the mood theyre in. Sunday scaries are real here now. Leaders will throw you under the bus and not pause to think about what you need from them to succeed just because they're constantly trying to please the upper management. You may be moving the earth and sky to get what they ask of you done and not get an inch of gratefulness or thank you- in fact they just move the bar and make you feel like you didnt reach it, change direction and not use your work at all that you stayed up all day and night doing to meet an out of the blue impossible deadline. Priorities dont shift around either, you need to make it work. This particular team has these problems but others have similar ones. Fear based leadership for this team which feels like worker bees holding up the team. You do make great friends as you share each others pain and hold each other up.

I enjoy that J&J has adapted as a large company to the demands of a modern workforce while keeping some of the tried and true cultural elements of a mature company. For example, incredibly generous time off, instead of ""unlimited PTO"". Territories are not unusually large for field teams and they are growing their patient support options through acquisitions of patient support hubs. The different teams work hard to make sure folks in different functions are supported. Such as national contracts are in place quickly and we feel the results downstream on a local level, or we can reach out to people in different functions to have candid conversations about what isn't happening that we've been told to expect. There's a great amount of partnership that's possible if you're willing to reach out. That part of the company culture is great to be a part of.","While the company has made huge strides by purchasing the PSC (Patient Service Center) and integrating the company's personnel as J&J employees, they are a sub par hub with training lapses. Many of the interactions I have with them lack accountability and professionalism. I think this hub would benefit from a different model and increased incentivization to perform at a higher level for patients.

1012,GSK,Healthcare,Technical service representative,2025-08-01,2.0,"There is really only one pro and that is the compensation and benefits are decent, certainly not a leader in the field, but decent.","Where to begin... GSK as a company is an after thought among larger industry players, their pipeline is weak, they haven't experienced significant growth in decades, and recent acquisitions suggest poor purchases and capital allocation. Structurally, there is significant bureaucracy in this company that is a death knell to innovation and efficiencies, there are many layers of middle management with countless directors, associate managers, and other fancy sounding titles. I worked at for this company for many years and I still don't know what many of these positions did and many seemed either redundant or highly specialized. When it comes to hiring individuals, there seems to be an incredible lack of attention on meaningful skill and capabilities, and more emphasis on diversity and value... which frankly is so hypocritical because this company holds a record for one the largest fines in US history related to their marketing practices and integrity. Competitors seem to be bounding ahead and no one in the company that has any kind of important role seems to offer a strategy or solution. It becomes very tiresome to listen to these people talk, but never do. If you want an okay salary and you can be easily convinced of ""great things to come"", by all means give this company a go, but make sure to bring you Excedrin because you will quickly start wondering how any of the people running this circus got their roles. If you do happen to end up working for this company, you will probably have two possible career paths. The most likely is a string of rejections, failed attempts, and being told how important you are without ever advancing. The less likely path is that the cohort of dunderheads see themselves in you, salute your perceived greatness, and usher you into their special club of world-changing disrupters that benefit from titles, but not brains. This company is so built on a foundation of nonsense that it will either implode or languish against its peers for future decades. If you end up working here, it will likely be just a job and not a career. You have yourself to blame if you choose to work here.",0.3612,Positive,0.8242,Positive,0.5927,Positive

Strong Research Infrastructure: Robust support systems, including access to biostatistics, IRB assistance, research computing, and administrative support. Focus on Translational Impact: Projects are often clinically relevant and aimed at real-world implementation, which is rewarding for applied researchers.

Variable PI Mentorship: Experience heavily depends on your mentor. Some labs offer strong guidance and career development; others are more hands-off. Transition to Faculty May Be Limited: Few internal postdocs are promoted directly to faculty roles; career progression often requires moving institutions.

Its stellar reputation and compelling mission were incredibly appealing, and I even accepted a lower total compensation package, driven by the prospect of contributing to a positive societal impact. I truly believed I could make a difference here. However, my actual experience has been quite different from those initial hopes. I work within an area often described as a ""platform,"" which initially seemed poised to be the future of healthcare, with the potential to dramatically improve patient outcomes. Unfortunately, this vision remains largely unrealized. Much of this can be attributed to the leadership at various levels, especially with the Mayo CEO and COO of my group. There's a palpable sense of internal pressure that often feels artificial, contributing to a generally difficult work environment. The organizational culture, at least within my domain, appears to be heavily influenced by fear, where deference to the COOs authority is often rewarded over contributions. Challenging the status quo, even when justified, will carry significant repercussions. This is particularly problematic when valid points are raised, as they can be perceived as threats by those in leadership positions. For example, there's a clear lack of strategic direction, evident in the sheer number of ""priorities"" that are simultaneously juggled – it's difficult to see how the 70th item on a list can genuinely be considered a priority. This highlights a significant disconnect in setting and executing clear objectives. While there are some talented individuals in leadership roles, it feels like many struggle to effectively manage upward when faced with less competent authority. Having worked in tech, I believe many of these leaders would be eaten up by standard directors at most tech companies. To focus a bit more on the COO, it's apparent to all that he has limited operational knowledge and seems to have achieved their position through aggressive interpersonal dynamics. He consistently undermines colleagues in public discussions. What follows is typically a frustrating cycle of criticism without any practical advice, leaving teams without a clear path forward. He is consistently proven wrong, but feels like he is either too dense to acknowledge he was wrong or has made a career of just continuing to belittle people in the hope they do not dare call him on it. Despite these challenges, there are truly exceptional individuals within the organization, particularly among the doctors working with the ""platform."" Interacting with the doctors has been inspiring, and their dedication is undeniable. My only observation is a desire for stronger advocacy from them against operational inefficiencies, especially concerning the COO, who lacks both relevant medical and technical expertise. Overall, I'm give this organization a 2-star rating. My respect for many of the individuals here, especially the medical professionals, and the inherent potential of the mission keep it from being a 1. However, for those in non-medical roles (or medical roles but devote most of their time to this team), the experience will be frustrating. There's a possibility for significant improvement, particularly with future leadership changes, but whether it's worth waiting to see that unfold, or joining before such changes occur, is a significant consideration.",0.8957,Positive,0.9823,Positive,0.9390000000000001,Positive
