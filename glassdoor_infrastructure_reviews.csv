Most meetings still done over Teams even with people sitting right next to you. They are not flexible on this, including any arrangements for physical health problems that are exasperated by sitting in an office or making long commutes every day.

People are burnt out and overworked and layoffs do occur When you hear that ""employees have worked here for 20-30 years, yes that is the case for many...but that is also the norm for that generation. Doubt that will be the case for those joining now.","- The number of PTO hours they will tell you will receive is a lie. In between Christmas to New Years offices have a ""holiday closure period"" where you are FORCED, yes FORCED to take PTO. If you are working a 9/80 schedule this means that you are forced to use 36 hours of PTO during those days. - In addition to the above, on a 9/80 schedule you are also forced to use 1 hour of PTO for every paid holiday (8 hours paid holiday with 1 hour of your own PTO used). This means that for well over 40 hours of PTO you are dictated when to use it. Strange and terrible policy. Employees should be able to CHOOSE when to use PTO so they can use it as a time to recharge and travel. - Forcing back to 3 days in office when many of are jobs are very challenging to perform in a group setting and there is very minimal office space in Reston. Many of us accepted job with 2 days if office and have very long commute. I do not blame HR for these polices because they are forced to carry them out - I blame Brendan, Craig, and senior leadership",,,

Requesting time off was easy, but probably because this was a contract position. 9/80 schedule was also great. Located in an area with nice area's to walk on breaks and lunch.","Training is abysmal and passed off to other staff members and even contract workers after general company module slideshow/video trainings. There is a code of management where the first statement is to presume everyone has the best intentions which is not observed across the board. When you try to communicate transparently to inquiries of ""actually working"" under the guise of a nice tone, it is only met with suspicion and micromanaging, even when you provide a detailed work log. Referencing convoluted emails (sent out to multiple people) that were supposed to give you steps in what/how to do things, and sending screenshots of previous statements confirming the information known in the moment will not get you anywhere. Around four times I had to end message threads with 'I apologize as this is the last information I was given (insert ref) but I know now and will continue forward with this information in mind.' It also wasn't a great experience to have a supervisor that would personally text me that I needed to cover up or wear a different bra because I was nipping during the colder months when I'd first come in the building, even though I'm in a cubicle all day and no one else said anything about it or even noticed if/when it did happen (I inquired to female co-workers on it and if I had made anyone uncomfortable in anyway). Contract was cut short with no explanation. During my time there were no issues related to productivity brought up. Only wardrobe, comments on my body, and presuming I wasn't working when my teams status didn't reflect correctly (although this happened frequently with the supervisor's).",,,

PTO allowance is more than other employers I've worked for in the past.","Employees are now required to be in the office 3 days per week; previously 2 days per week. Brendan/Craig (and all the other middle management who drink the kool-aid) purport this change will lead to ""more collaboration"", but from what I've seen it's just given people more time to waste standing around talking about non-work related stuff (usually for hours on end). Other than that, 401K isn't matched until after working one year. It's a fair amount, but not THAT much more than other places to warrant not matching from the very beginning. Additionally raises seem to be small, and promotions don't really seem to be a thing.",,,

There is very knowledgeable people on these projects who are always willing to help.,Leadership made us come back to office 3 days per week instead of the alternating remote weeks we had before. Select people on our teams get to work full time remote. They are working the same position as the rest of us. They don’t have to commute over an hour of the horrible traffic to work in person three times a week. There is no option for us in person people to work fully remote like the ones who are working remote. The excuse given is “to create a more collaborative environment”. How are we creating a more exclusive environment when a lot of supervisors and senior engineers are still working fully remote? We also have to use PTO for an entire week or go unpaid between Christmas and New Years as offices are closed. You don’t get to choose whether you get to work or not those weeks nor get a bonus.,,,

Unfortunately, the company does not seem to address situations where poor management contributes to employee turnover. Some managers receive strong feedback from upper leadership but fail to provide adequate support and respect to their teams. A specific example is the executive manager of AI, Fatemeh Mirrashed, reporting directly to the CIO.

Some of the best people cut loose or gone. The younger people.....it is obvious they haven't been mentored at all. (Really lacking in know-how.)

Interestingly enough, I overheard one of them (one of their ""section leads"" or whatever it was called) acknowledge that privately. A generation ago, she never would have been considered for that based on her level of experience. On the personality side, one stunner was the fact a woman I had the displeasure of working with the first time I was there (incredibly rude, abrasive person, whom it seemed like was never there) has actually been made a higher up in the organization's management!

It all started years ago on the island of Puerto Rico when I was offered an opportunity with Kiewit under the Underground Division. The project was located in the heart of Río Piedras, and I was entrusted with overseeing safety supervision for half of the alignment. At the time, I had no idea that this opportunity would shape my life in such a profound way. As I continued with the company, countless opportunities for growth and learning became evident. I vividly remember when I was asked if I wanted to continue working for Kiewit in the United States. At first, I hesitated. It was a major decision, and fear of the unknown made me take a few weeks to think it over. But after discussing it with my family, we decided it was time for a change—a chance to give our kids a different lifestyle and new opportunities. That decision marked the beginning of a life filled with challenges, growth, and adventure. From overcoming language barriers to moving from place to place, every challenge became part of the journey. Looking back, I can proudly say that I raised my kids, traveled the world, and built a career I am deeply grateful for—all thanks to the company I represent Kiewit. Kiewit has given me opportunities beyond what I ever imagined, and I’m honored to be part of this incredible organization.",I really don’t have anything as cons,,,

You will be overworked with little to no resources when people go on medical leave, are terminated, and are expected to keep up with business demand. They will squeeze you to the last drop hoping you quit if not they will work quickly to terminate you. I was approved to go on medical leave but they terminated me 3 days before having my knee surgery done. I will need to look for other ways to cover my healthcare costs because they chose to terminate me because I didn't order equipment on time. Although I had a final warning prior to this for things they technically failed to do on their end, they don't care and will do whatever it takes to pin you to it and create an elaborate narrative to give you the boot. The company is disgusting overall with a lot of favoritism involved. You will need to fall in line and be a yes man no matter what. Their Skanska values are meaningless, once you are there long enough, you will see they don't stick to any of their core values. It's no surprise this company has been involved in many criminal offenses in the past and still stick to their ways. You are a number on a sheet that is easily replaceable. You most need to drive your car to many places which for the IRS expense rate won't cover long term wear and continuing rising costs. Management doesn't care about their team, they pretend very well that they do. They just sold an entire division of IT to another company DXC technologies and threw everyone away like they were trash.

633,Turner Construction,Infrastructure,Anonymous employee,,,2025-05-08,2.0,,,,,,,I was able to pay my bills.,"In one word: weird. Leadership culture feels disconnected and performative. Managers often act one way in front of executives and entirely differently with staff: a sign of inconsistent values and poor integrity. There’s little to no mentorship culture; most managers don’t seem interested or equipped to mentor, and instead rely on caricaturing the company values, “optics,” and “perception” when interacting upwards. There’s no cultural continuity between job sites. It’s a gamble whether you land with a PM who’s solid (usually because they came from somewhere else) or someone who just reinforces the weird status-quo. The main office recently moved from Miami to Miramar, which management said was to “centralize” it between staff and jobsites… everyone knows they just wanted to cut rent (and save for their self-designed interior renovations, which might be nice if the office wasn’t in the middle of nowhere. It has no foot traffic and requires 20ish employees (mostly based in and hired from Miami) to commute hours to take video calls… day in, day out, the same 20ish employees warehoused in the middle of nowhere taking video calls. Worse yet, after moving to Miramar, the work-from-home policy was cut to “improve culture,” but no mentoring or meaningful interaction actually happens… just weird silence in a painfully open concept office. Leadership seems uninterested in engaging with or developing the people under them, ironically, considering how hard they championed for the return-to-office policies. Upward mobility is hard to achieve, or really even want, since there are too many middle managers with questionable character as it is. It seems like they’re more interested in trading on politics, scarcity, and the “sorry I’m unavailable, busy, booked, out-of-office, commuting to a client’s office in Miami” look to give the appearance of an authority status. It’s hard to feel inspired or bought into ivory castles. It’s also hard to tell whether they think they’re above mentoring, or just don’t know how to do it. Maybe it’s both. Either way, it adds up to a weird, tone-deaf approach that discourages growth and connection. This feedback is not solicited or welcome by the new GM, who is very proud of his new role and new office. He’s a nice guy personally, but many do not think he was ready for this role. Power, especially in the middle of nowhere, has a funny way of revealing character. Upper HQ management, good as it may be, is too disconnected due to too many layers of middle management to see what’s going on, especially since all those layers are putting on their best performance for them every time they visit the office. I’m sure this Miami experience is not unique to Miami. Maybe that’s just how corporate life goes.",,,

Atkins North America was acquired when Atkins in London bought a notorious US engineering based in Florida, PBS&J (Post, Buckley, Shuh and Jernigan). I didn't do enough research when hired and found out too late I was working for a company that has been prosecuted multiple times for serious illegalities, and some of the executives who participated but escaped prosecution are still there! PBS&J has been indicted for bribing government officials, illegal campaign contributions, and was a private company put on the chopping blocks to sell for being so poorly managed when several of the employees embezzled millions upon millions of dollars. As recent as 2016 the company was struggling financially because of legal costs and fines to the extent the focus became finishing out existing contracts rather than procuring new ones...an indicator they do not want new business and are likely to chop off the US engineering wing and spin those employees out to another company. Do your research before accepting a job there, the good old boy network that didn't previously get caught or prosecuted in the illegalities is still working there, and they haven't changed much in being secretive about what they are doing!!

913,Atkins Réalis,Infrastructure,Safety and risk management consultant,,,2016-07-12,3.0,,,,,,,"Worldwide organization with job opportunities around the globe. Recognized name within the industry. Good company for designers, architects or engineers.",The bottom line for the company takes precedent over employee development particularly at the mid level grades (11-14). Not very good at implementation of field work. Can design projects but don't have competent construction planners. Annual restructuring of business units as the market shifts. This is especially true for the Middle East (MENA) region. The employee development and review process is a joke. The PDR is completed every Mar-Apr and then it's just a check box on a list. It's not used for promotion or development and if you change jobs or managers mid year forget about the PDR. Nothing from the previous year will be applicable. The PDR is a cut and paste exercise that most employees hate. Salaries are generally lower than the market rate due to structure of the contracts. Atkins tends to bid low to win the work and then find people willing to work for lower salaries while releasing more senior staff that have become too expensive. Promotion from within is limited and takes years. Annual salary increases are 0-2% if your lucky. Once you do achieve an increase you are a liability to the profit driven bottom line. You're better to leave and come back to get a promotion or salary increase. Performance on several contracts has deteriorated because competent staff have left or been made redundant due to the low salary threshold that Atkins has. Replacement or newly hired staff are brought in based on their salary expectations and not competency.,,,

Unfortunately the Pro's end there.","Turnover - Atkins has an incredibly high amount of turnover and it got even worse when the economy got a little better. Turnover was so high in California that they had to close a few offices because there was just no one left to work in the buildings they were leasing. The high turnover also made it difficult to deliver successful projects. Inevitably everything I was working on was a hand me down from some other project manager that quit and the budget/deliverables were all over the place. This lead to a ""left holding the bag"" situation where I was being put on notice by Atkins management and clients for either being over budget or not delivering products on time. By the time I left I was so battered by clients and internal Atkins management that I had mild PTSD. I apologize to anyone that took over the projects I left them. Trust me I know how you are feeling. Get out while you can! Management - There were some great senior managers that were trying as hard as they could to ""right the ship"". The good ones didn't last long only because a person can only take so much beating down by clients and corporate management that they quit. This lead to some desperation hires and promotions of staff that were under qualified and unfit for that sort of job. Other regional managers were working in satellite offices halfway across the state/country and were just warm bodies. None of the regional directors I worked with were in anyway helpful to my struggles and clearly did not listen to my suggestions (or if they did they ultimately had no power in their job to act on these suggestions). Administrative Duties - Sometimes I felt like Peter Gibbons from office space where I was getting called by 5 different people about the same thing. Usually about my budget forecasts. Forecasting was such a brutal monthly exercise, that depending on the number of projects you were managing, could take a full day to complete. Also why was the forecasting left to staff? Was this time billable? Not a chance. Better Options - The economy is in a better situation and if you can get hired at Atkins, you can get hired somewhere better. Take the time to look elsewhere.

1002,DPR Construction,Infrastructure,Senior project engineer,,,2025-11-12,2.0,,,,,,,"Not really any pros in comparison to other similar companies. Having worked at Balfour Beatty and Batson-Cook prior, none of them are really special in any significant ways. Salaries are the same. I will say that in comparison to Batson they have a simpler progression path for PE's. At Batson it is PE I, PE II, Senior PE, then APM, then PM. At DPR it is PE, Senior PE, then PM. Also, a lot of the people at this Business Unit are truly wonderful people to work with, but a few bad apples in management spoil the bunch.","I have waited a few months since leaving DPR to write this. I have given a lot of thought to this. “Title-less Company” - I guess there is a little positive to this, but overall it’s a negative. I feel it’s just an easier way for them to gate keep promotions and advancement. It also makes it really confusing for anyone starting to know who are the seniors you can go to for guidance. Sure, it’s cool that titles aren’t used or prevalent, but why? If you earned a title you should be recognized for it, and it would have helped understand team member's roles better if they at least had titles in their email signatures. More than anything it’s a “culture” selling point that just makes your job unnecessarily confusing. Culture - A word all construction corps throw around like they’ve got the best one. Frankly, they’re all the same. Spend WAY too much money on company events, outings, wine bars, etc. Between all of my previous employers DPR definitely spent the most on their appearance of culture and events. Sure, it’s fun and great to get people together, but when your business unit is falling behind in its revenue goals it’s time to pull back and reconsider where those funds are being applied. Obviously, they aren’t going to come out and admit they’re cutting staff due to lack of work, but that’s what they did in Q3 of ‘25. The Healthcare division hired me to be a PE the prior September. I never got to perform that role and instead was put into estimating the first couple of months and then moved to SPW (Self Perform Work) for the remainder of my time there. They chose to move over other team members from SPW to the Healthcare team prior to moving me because those team members were cheaper, even though I voiced frequently I did not want to stay in SPW and had the healthcare experience needed on those projects. SPW - DO NOT join this team if you have the option. It’s currently being led by someone with little to no field experience and a massive ego. Narcissists are not good leaders. I learned of bad decisions by upper management in SPW almost weekly. Putting a team member with 0 experience in DFH (doors, frames, hardware) on one of the largest and most complex jobs the unit has, in the middle of the scope, without proper guidance while you have team members with actual experience available was the biggest bad decision I saw. I also saw logistic decisions required for each project that made no sense. A project with 10 doors does not need twice the amount of material handling to “keep all operations the same”. DFH specifically has never been profitable for the BU. Under the current leadership it won’t ever be. I managed to make 3 projects profitable for DFH in my short time at DPR, and I believe this intimidated the executive over it because he couldn’t do it. Which led to me being let go. My termination - A couple of things, and this is important to everyone working at DPR or any corporate construction company. They listed the reason for my termination as “Unsatisfactory Performance”. 30 days prior they had a meeting with me where they made an official mark-up of things for me to improve on. This was all obviously planned for multiple reasons: 1) If they document a negative employee review 30 days prior to termination of employee, they do not have to pay unemployment for that employee when they fire them. I was never given any solid reasons for my termination or the review. The “executive” that set all of this up grasped at straws of very minimal things and mistakes I had made as examples in the review meeting, and wouldn’t even give me a single reason when I was terminated. As someone with a lot of experience in construction, I practically begged for reasons for my termination. I literally got nothing but silence. Then I applied for unemployment to give me more time in my job search. I was rejected due to the review documentation 30 days prior. The documentation they sent to the GA department of labor did not even include the comments I added to the review. 2) If the BU (business unit) is not hitting their goal they will begin to cut the higher paid PE's and PM's first. Regardless of their competency in comparison to cheaper team members. I saw this with another PM shortly after I was terminated. That PM had been with DPR for 8 years, had a negative 30-day prior review regardless of their great performance, and was then terminated in the same fashion as me. There are likely others, but they get those people out of the office in those 30 days so your termination can stay quiet. Specifically to me, after my 30 days review all of my ongoing projects were taken away from me (6 or 7 scopes) and I was assigned as an assistant to a PM for one drywall scope. That PM did not need an assistant. I was given tasks that did not make sense but at the time I did not care. Why would I pour my passion into a role I never wanted or asked for that was beneath my level of experience and ability? I just kept my head down and did was I was told. The year prior another PE was handled the same way as me. Put me with that PM, let that PM know the intent is to fire me after the 30-days are up. Have that PM document and look for reasons to terminate so the company can be justified. In both instances it was the same PM and Exec making these calls. There were likely others handled this way. Trainings: Terrible training. The SPW exec gave me a 30 mins crash course on one of the most unreasonably complicated budget softwares I have ever seen. I was able to figure it all out on my own, but others with less experience continue to struggle after months of using the software. It is a cheap software, completely outdated by at least 10 years, and ridiculously complicated for its role. Balfour Beatty and Batson-cook's systems were not much better, but they at least spent proper time training new employees before giving them tasks in it. A common thing I heard from upper management was ""sink or swim"" when I asked why we were putting inexperienced team members on tasks they knew little of. That is not a proper way to lead people. It is a lazy cheap option that allows upper management scapegoats when that employee inevitably fails. Office politics - At this point I get that corporations inevitably have office politics. For the first time in my career I actually drank the cool-aid at DPR. I believed in my first 6 months that they were different, that I actually found a company I would be happy at for years. Then the veil dropped and I saw that DPR is no better than the rest. Gatekeeping roles, bad leaders in positions of team management, and whispers behind your back by trusted colleagues. To upper management at any construction corp. it is all a game. How can they make themselves look better and their ""competition"" (other team mates) look worse. It was a daily thing I did not even notice until 6 months in. They will not tell you of concerns to your face, instead they will document and tattle to their superior's for brownie points, and that behavior is rewarded by superiors. In Summary: If you are early in your career as a PE then take the opportunities where you can to join the corporate GC's. Learn everything you can from them. How they operate, how their contracts work, what their systems are, how they perform scope reviews, etc. Everything you can. Spend a few years with them and then get out. Find a smaller GC that is not incorporated yet and join them. You will likely be paid more and will not have to worry about being gatekept from advancement. This is the strategy I have used and it worked perfectly. DPR is not a terrible place to work. Just keep your eyes and ears open, and maneuver intelligently through their hoops.",,,

If you are a good PM they will not let you off the job site, and you will be placed on more and more difficult projects with lower and lower quality PEs. The regions are controlled by a few people who are not the BULs. Senior leadership cares more about soft issues and storytelling than instilling work ethic and teaching people how to be builders. We shouldn't have to convince people we're here to build great things, we should be able to show it. They also have a problem with older tenured employees who no longer want to ""work"" getting moved into people roles instead of asking them to leave.

In Australia, they acquired Hyder consulting to establish their footprint here. They have a lot of experience in major project delivery, particularly in transport; highways, rail, ports, active transport are their bread and butter projects. This experience allows them to leverage opportunities on major Australian infrastructure projects. There is hardly a major transport infrastructure project that they haven't been involved in recently. They have a strong Design Management focus and a lot of good technical people and can mobilise large teams quickly. The relationships with major Government clients, contractors and other clients appear strong and the reputation is typically pretty good. Salary and benefits are also pretty good in my opinion and working arrangements are very flexible and forgiving. Their offices and facilities are good, albeit there are not enough desks for the amount of staff. Free gym access is a bonus!","Whilst they are good at winning and delivering major projects, they seem to be lost as to how to win traditional consulting work, especially in Perth, WA. There is no clear strategic plan for growth or for having a sustainable baseline workload, it is just all about throwing people at the next major project that comes along to keep people in jobs. They prioritise major projects over anything else and therefore if you have something small to deliver, you get left with the dregs of the resource pool. They put technical people in Managerial roles based purely on their technical abilities and most of them are either too bogged down in project delivery or have poor people/communication skills, so critical decisions and/or issues do not get dealt with effectively or efficiently. Some staff seem to be able to get away with murder because they ""appear"" to be good at delivering on projects, whereas others get punished or ignored for having a personality because they are not quite as strong technically as others (or at least appear not to be: i.e. they are not talking themselves up constantly and brown nosing all the time). The management structure is flat, which sounds good in theory, but in reality it is a mess. No one wants to make a decision and no one can tell you clearly how to get from A to B without going up through the food chain and escalating things all the way to the top. They don't recognise previous experience at other companies when it comes to Project Management and Design Management, so if you want to join those streams, you will need to start at the bottom and ""prove yourself"". It is just absolutely ridiculous for someone with many years' experience in PM and DM to have to start at the bottom again!! I don't get it AT ALL...",,,

Most seemed to have spent their entire career in a cubicle, at a desk, hiding behind a computer monitor. Was in their construction services section. Manager was on some kind of hybrid schedule, think they only showed up at the office a few times a week. The rest was probably work from home. Needed an endorsement from my manager regarding a certification I had tested and passed. They bungled it and I was denied the certification. Manager doubled down and claimed they did nothing wrong with their part of it. The Rosemont office never really performed Phase III Construction services, so you were always farmed out as a subconsultant. Several of client consulting firms sent to were subpar firms with low bar staff. Overall, most staff seemed standoffish when engaging with them.

This is a hostile, isolating place that will drain everything from you.","If you are a person with a disability, or if you value basic dignity in the workplace, stay far away from this company. My experience here showed me how little leadership understands about legal and ethical obligations toward employees who require accommodations. Rather than engage in the required interactive process, they delayed, deflected, and outright denied the support I was entitled to. Instead of receiving meaningful accommodations, I was subjected to constant procedural harassment: endless documentation demands, shifting expectations, and a punitive performance plan built on factual inaccuracies. The scrutiny was relentless — managers tracked my time down to 15-minute intervals, withheld paychecks over manufactured “timecard issues,” and used my disability as leverage to justify harsher treatment. The culture is deeply toxic. Engineers who struggle to communicate effectively are promoted into management roles where they weaponize procedures against employees rather than supporting them. Yelling, obscenities, and targeted hostility are normalized. Leadership’s focus is on protecting themselves and looking productive, not actually producing results. What’s worse is HR’s role. They were fully aware of the harassment and did nothing. They ignored emails, failed to intervene, and consistently sided with management. Their silence condoned the abuse and created an environment where discrimination is allowed to thrive unchecked. For people with disabilities, this workplace is not only unsupportive — it is actively harmful. The constant stress, retaliation, and gaslighting take a psychological toll. Requests for flexibility or fairness are met with hostility and punishment. This is not a safe environment for anyone, but it is especially dangerous for those of us who rely on accommodations to succeed. In short: avoid this company at all costs. If you value your health, your livelihood, or your legal rights, do not put yourself through what I endured.",,,

I did personally have to go into the office every few weeks or every other week, but it's better than being required to be in the office 5 days of the work week. OT is available if needed. If it's consistent, management will ask why and as long as you're doing your work, they'll approve. PTO, as an hourly employee, was accrued with each pay not given you to as a lump sum which I didn't feel was an issue. The department I worked in was large enough that you felt supported and able to reach out for assistance if necessary. The team was also incredibly knowledgeable and willing to help you. Training was a bit odd as there's no one specific individual who's training you, so sometimes you'll end up with different information on how to do something than someone else does. But it's very much a ""as long as it gets done and correctly,"" kind of environment. Mistakes that are made are understood and fixable. Salary was decent for the work that you do.","The only ""con,"" is that there isn't much room for advancement.

1452,WSP Global,Infrastructure,Anonymous employee,,,2025-07-26,1.0,,,,,,,"I must enter five words here, I guess.","This company is the quintessential example of the drawbacks of working for a large corporation. I cannot in good conscience recommend this company as a place of employment to anyone. At the broadest level, the company markets itself as “world-shapers… with commitment to making a positive impact,” while its biggest and most cherished clients are some of the world’s most notoriously unethical and unscrupulous contributors to environmental damage and the war machine. Its senior and director-level leadership in the U.S. comprises an “old boy’s club” of nepotistic hires who have no technical skillset and who are criminally out-of-touch with their workforce. The misguided pace of acquisitions and lack of consistent or logical organizational structure is a result of two conflicting impulses: the blind intention to grow without coherent, long-term strategic planning and the unwillingness to demote/remove/hold accountable each other at this level of leadership. Instead the consequences of these actions fall upon the most frontline workers within the company: consultants, technical experts, analysts, marketers, and their lower management levels. As an employee for this company, regardless of your department, you can expect to be overworked and without resources; shuffled around to different teams or roles without warning or input; and held accountable to ever-changing policies regarding workflow, performance, and pay. More recently, likely due to an industrial recession and the de-funding of public clients, the company has also begun to attempt to save costs by replacing its skilled laborers with cheap and inexperienced hires outsourced internationally. So employees can also expect to work more and more alongside coworkers whose working hours, inexperience, and language barriers are impediments to their daily workflow. This is in no way the fault of their international teammates, who are genuinely doing everything they can to rise to these new roles, and who also feel a great amount of pressure to perform well in this circumstance. Which brings me, finally, to the company’s “people culture.” I have worked across several industries and for other companies within this industry and the people culture at WSP is by far the most toxic, fear-based, duplicitous one I have ever experienced. Because this company is led by a group of people who would rather ignore, sweep under the rug, or altogether remove anyone or -thing who might speak against them, instances of gross (and often illegal) misconduct abound across every department and in every region. I advise prospective employees to stay far, far away from this company. And I advise my former colleagues to stay grounded and stick by one another.",,,

We also don’t get paid sick live. There is a growing trend of employees across the board having nervous breaks - only then will they offer time off to avoid a law suit. They also constantly push managers to hire overseas in countries with less employer regulation like India to exploit as much labor as possible within their unrealistic budgets.

Their lack of professional has their own team leads looking for other jobs because the workload is too much for the small amount of people who are there. They will say ""weekends free"" and then do mandatory Saturdays to ""catch up"" instead of hiring more people. No paid sick days, if you don't come in you can use PTO, but still receive a point. Whether that's for childcare issues, or even if you have covid. They made several employees stay while sick bc if they went home they would get a point. They do not recognize doctors notes there. Everything is for the benefit of a few tops offices and everyone else is expendable. Stay away from this company.",,,

1466,WSP Global,Infrastructure,Senior associate,,,2025-06-17,3.0,,,,,,,Principals and project managers are very good and helpful.,Junior staff is not trained and has to learn without much guidance. For instance no formal revit/cad training. Revit modeling has custom scripting and families that cause drawings to be dummied in. Most likely due to legacy work arounds that have been built on instead of abandoned because revit has it built in. Company is also offshoring work to India and Mexico.

1495,WSP Global,Infrastructure,Scientist senior hydrogeologist,,,2024-07-15,2.0,,,,,,,The company pays you well and is great about keeping technology up to date.,"The office I worked at was very clickish and was apparently unable to integrate me who is a senior scientist into their projects. There are a number of very bad project managers but they've been there forever so everybody thinks they are fantastic because the clients love them and they can bill them forever. More importantly, the projects they work on are just kind of money pits where there is not any real goal to complete them. Mostly government projects but even big industry. The office is completely disconnected from the state of Maine unlike most consulting firms there. I found an arrogance that was not supported by the quality of work in many ways. I'm sure they would have their criticism on me but I have worked in Maine for 37 years in consulting and was appalled by my experience.",,,

NOPE. WSP in the U.S. does not offer any health insurance plans that include coverage prior to meeting a deductible. This means that I need to forfeit necessary health services - like therapy and physical therapy - that I cannot afford. These services were a mere $25 copay with my prior insurance and will now cost me up to $1500 per session with WSP's insurance (before meeting my deductible - which will take some time to do). A firm this big should be able to provide better benefits for their staff and this blatant disregard for employee well-being makes me wonder where their money is really going. At the very least, it shows me they really don't care about their staff at all.",,,
